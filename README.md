# 💬 Gemini Chatbot UI – My First AI Internship Task!

Welcome to my first AI project built during my internship at **Aiwallah**! 🚀

This chatbot UI was built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and integrates the **Gemini 2.5 Flash API** to simulate a real AI chat experience.

## 🧠 What This Project Is About

I created a chatbot interface where users can chat with Google’s Gemini API in real-time. The app handles both frontend and backend logic and showcases how to integrate GenAI into real-world web apps.

## 🤯 Problems I Faced & What I Learned

### ⚙️ Frontend:
- Message bubble alignment was tricky at first (user ↔ bot).
- Styling chat UI in dark mode with Tailwind CSS was a great learning experience.
- Improved scroll behavior, responsiveness, and input UX.

### 🔄 Backend:
- Faced 400 errors due to incorrect API body structure.
- Learned how to use `POST` requests correctly with `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Used **Postman** to test and debug Gemini 2.5 Flash endpoint.
- Understood how to structure `contents`, `parts`, `generationConfig`, and `safetySettings`.

### 🔐 API:
- Figured out how to generate and safely use Google API keys.
- Understood the importance of limiting output with `maxOutputTokens`.
